Getting started:
-
With our slack bot, all you have to do is type /summarize and specify how long you want to go back in order to get a summary of all the messages in a channel within that time! 

Or, you can even schedule summaries to be posted daily or weekly!

With every summary, links to the first message in each conversation are provided. This way, you can navigate quicker to important conversations and read through individual messages.

Example summary:

How I built it:
-
- Built the overarching slack app as well as the UI using Python in the Slack Bolt framework.
- Utilized the Slack API to pull slack channel history, and the GoDaddy CaaS API with a ChatGPT 3.5-Turbo model to summarize messages using AI.
- Developed an algorithm for time manipulation with obtaining channel history as well as displaying scheduled summaries.
- Achieved a 99.8% positivity rate for summaries as well as up to an 800% increase in summarization speed through multi-channel threading.
