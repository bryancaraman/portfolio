General details:
-

For UC Berkeley's hackathon, our team realized there was a major gap in physical function after patients suffer a stroke. Even after going through a stroke, there is often nerve damage in the hand which completely takes away physical function.

So we came up with a way to aid patients after this trauma:
- Developed a glove using arduinos that assists in rehabilitation of the hand after nerve damage
- Automates hand exercises based on the nerve damage and user strength
- Measures each finger's individual strength as well as total strength to target specific muscles and showcase growth over time

Check out a video of our first (very basic) prototype: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VI_90eHESPU

How we built it:
-
- Created a glove with a motor and pully system, powered by Arduinos, that could automate hand
exercises
- Implemented graphviz using Java for finger-specific data visualization, developed a weight-based
backtracking algorithm for targeting weaker muscles by analyzing each fingerâ€™s individual strength, as
well as the Android Canvas API for user interface development
- Integrated all development to create an android app that displays the data, allows users to see progress,
and lets users pick their exercises
