General details:
-

In life-threatening emergencies, seconds save lives. UEMR shortens response time and improves the accessibility of care for members of the UT Dallas community by having EMT's and resources available and nearby. But some of the tools in use to communicate and track emergencies are outdated and not as useful as they could be.

Respondent is a cross-platform mobile app that allows Student EMT's on campus to keep track of and respond to emergencies on campus efficiently.

How we built it:

- Developed the backend of the user authentication system for EMT logins using JavaScript and OAuth2.0 protocol
- Built an API using JavaScript and OpenAPI specification that processes server requests of incoming emergencies and posts the response to the app
- Utilized Python and the pandas library to analyze and graphically display response time data, sped up simulated response time by 34%
- Interfaced with the OpenAI API to create a message-based AI chatbot that assists responders
