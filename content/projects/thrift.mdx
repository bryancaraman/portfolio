General details:
-
With our online thrift store, anyone can upload and sell their clothes to the world!

Our team of 5 GoDaddy bootcampers worked meticulously to make the website intuitive and appealing for anyone to navigate. The home page shows off some featured items and new releases, while the shop page allows anyone to filter and look through all inventory!

How we built it:
-
- Utilized Next.js, React.js, Node.js, MaterialUI components, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to put together the front-end interface
- Built an API using Python, as well as Swagger with OpenAPI specifications for creating products and adding cart items, performed CRUD operations through a PostgreSQL database
- Created custom Docker images and deployed Docker containers for the API, webapp, and database
- Expanded possible API requests by 240% and achieved 100% code coverage through unit testing
