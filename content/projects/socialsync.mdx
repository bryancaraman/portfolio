General details:
-
Our team of 6 revamped the GoDaddy Social Sync page to better fit customer's expectations for their social media presence, winning the GoDaddy internal hackathon!

The original page only allowed users to pick from 4 AI generated social media usernames that would repeat after generating new recommendations and often be taken on all social media platforms.

Our rebuilt page gave the user 8 username options that were:
- available on all social media platforms
- unique for every new generation

as well as the ability to 
- filter usernames by their availability on certain platforms the user is interested in
- pin usernames so they stay for the next generation

Final redevelopment:

How we built it:
-
- Adjusted GoCaaS API request parameters to include a state of all previously generated names so everything was unique
- Built an algorithm using JavaScript to make quick API requests to all social media platforms, figuring out whether usernames were taken and continuing until there were 8 available names
- Cleaned up the UI using GoDaddy components to display all 8 options as well as "exact match" and "available across all available selected platforms" banners
- Added filtering on the page so that the algorithm would only make requests to selected platforms
- Increased efficiency of GoCaaS API request to ChatGPT 3.5-Turbo AI model by 150%
