General details:
-

Our team of 4 had recently discovered a major phishing problem affecting students at our school just before we headed to UT Austin's hackathon. 

We tackled this problem by building Securify: A chrome extension that protects users from phishing/scam emails

- provides a colored indicator next to emails in a user's inbox indicating whether an email may be malicious or safe 
- allows users to report suspicious emails so that other users are informed of similar malicious emails

How we built it:
-
- Utilized the Django framework with Python to build the back-end for the reporting system, and MonogDB to store the data for reported emails
- Built the front-end of the chrome extension with JavaScript, and CSS to provide an indicator whether inbox emails have been reported by institutions or users as malicious
- Implemented the algorithm blending user reports and institution blacklists to flag suspicious emails
